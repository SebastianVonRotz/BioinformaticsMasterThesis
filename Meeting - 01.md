Thanks for your visit today. As discussed please find some links regarding our discussion:

Nanopore sequence analysis (custom pipelines to EPI2ME):

Guppy basecaller/demultiplexer: requires community access, I’ll ask Fabio to send you an invite as it seems that I can’t do this myself. See also   
https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1727-y and https://github.com/rrwick/Basecalling-comparison

EPI2ME platform: See also workflow videos under first link above. The access requires community access, I’ll ask Fabio to send you an invite as it seems that I can’t do this myself. 

Comprehensive nanopore training course (covers several aspects from raw reads to bacterial genome annotation):

I am also sharing in attachment:
-	a report we wrote together with Fabio regarding an internal project using the nanopore.
-	the readme of a script that Fabio obtained end of last year that could be a very good starting point for your work (although we haven’t been testing it so far with this kind of data).
-	an overview of the CRISPR workflow used so far by Fabio.

Concerning providing access to the semester works (see references in the pdf report attached), I need first to check approval that I can do this.
