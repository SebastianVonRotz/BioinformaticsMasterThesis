# Questions
* Metadata for both runs?
* Basecalled data?
* Aggregate all fast5_pass files for basecalling ?
	* Yes
* How to hanlde the skipped files?
	* These should be fast5 files which do not contain the fastq file
* When is Pass of Fail generated? (These are still fast5 files therefore not yet basecalled)
* Should the reruns be treated as separate data?
	* No
* Are the new flowcell kit combination already in guppy basecaller?

# To Do
Resequence the basecalling
fast5 files contains fastq output
Get all of the files from the workstation
Process the 16S RNA Samples with normalization of classified reads and change
Check if skipped fast5 file do not have fastq file
