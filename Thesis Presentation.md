# Goal

As pointed out in a previous message you talk will probably contain:
. Problem statement
. Methods
. Main result(s), or current state if you don't have results yet

5min is short. You will have to focus on the essentials. Please time your presentation when rehearsing.

Here is the envisioned format:

3-4 slides in about 8min (per Person):
1 Title-slide with your name, your supervisors name, and the title of your thesis
2 Motivation / Problem Statement: explain the topic of your thesis and/or pose the central question(s)
3 Approaches / Methods: give an idea on how you tackle the problem
4 Results / current state: The results can be preliminary. You can also highlight one particular result or simply give the status of your progress.

If you are only doing Milestone 1 or 2 this semester then you can focus on points 1--3.
