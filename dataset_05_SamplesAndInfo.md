# Structure
The flowcell has been restarted until pore depletion (b-d are therefore reruns)

# Info
The fast5 files from the two runs 0014 and 0015 are located in the following folder: /cfs/earth/scratch/iunr/egsb/Data_voro/
The sequencing was re-started several times until both flow cells were “dead” thus the different subfolders for each run (a-d).
Some runs were already basecalled (only fast basecall then except 0014a with only 10% basecalled in accurate mode) and have fast5_pass or fast5_fail folders.
For the first run (0014a) with have also fast5_skipped as these were not basecalled (too much time consuming with the accurate basecalling).

Further infos are in the excel file:
