# Structure


# Info
Unfortunately the flow cell had only low amount of pores still available (n=33) when 56 where available last week. Another run without basecalling is running for the next 12 hours.
Surprisingly, three barcodes (06-08; Nicolaâ€™s samples) are also not appearing again and we have no idea why at this stage but strongly suspect the DNA extraction procedure.
Thanks to Nicola, the run includes samples from Julian that needed to be repeated as follow:
BC01	24-0
BC02	1-0
BC03	43-0
BC04	44-0
BC05	42-0

Only few pores available, three samples still not producing any data
