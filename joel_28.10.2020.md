### Further ToDos
- Reporting on the fast5 files
-  create a manifest file which holds the parameter of each step
- Make it user friendly and accessible, example galaxy server

### For the Mapping and assembly steps:
- kraken / centrifuge already installed on hpc
- After filtering / triming into tax identification


### Dataset Priority
16S RNA 1st prio
amoA 2nd prio
Crispr 2nd prio

### Further notes
Crispr Finder results into structured form
amoA -> Alignemt SNIPS or Assembly approach
General goal of taking envrionment sample, amplify target gene
