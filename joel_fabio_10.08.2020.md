# Discussion Topics Master

## Topics Theoretical Background
* Expand the **Bioinformatics Tool List**
* Look into best practice of establishing **bioinformatics workflows**
* **Wiki contribution** and Documentation:
	* ZHAW HPC
	* Own Documentation Wiki
* **Background** and description on Data (e.g. CRISPR)
* **Reuse of Content** and expand from the Track Module?

## Topics Practical Work
* Create an automated workflow for the Amplicon/CRISPR Data (From raw data to report)
	* Also phylogenetic analysis of the CRISPR Results
	* Available data:
		* two sets one with decoy one without for CRISPR (already basecalled)
		* Upcoming 16S rRNA meta
* Workflow Visualizations needed ?
* Create a more general workflow for Amplicon sequencing
* Expand applications on the HPC (Docker, UI, etc.)
* Other Topics?
	* Available data:
		* -?

Goal from raw reads to data ready for alignment
Program for aligning (canadian) modification for CRIPSR alignment
Metagenomic 16S RNA sequencing ()

Two Workflows
* One specific Amplicon (CRISPR) -> Assemble
* Several Amplicons (16S rRNA)

Analysis
* CRISPR Tree Builiding

Challenge in general at:
* Filtering / Assembly / Mapping
