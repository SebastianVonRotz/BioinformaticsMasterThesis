### Notes on the data as example
I have made available the data from our two amplicon sequencing runs with MinION on the HPC under the following path: /cfs/earth/scratch/iunr/egsb/Data_voro
This corresponds to 70.5 Gb of raw data.** The basecalling was already performed for both runs (performed “live” during the run on our Workstation no. 6, i.e. several days…) and this explains why two folders are present**: fast5_fail and fast5_pass. Unfortunately it’s not possible to go back to the ‘real’ raw data (before basecalling) but it can be that it is just the matter of merging these two folders. Due to the heavy computation that is required we adapted our procedure to not perform this live but as a post processing step on the HPC with Guppy.
**The run 0004 contains the data from Simon (amoA) and Samuel/Fabio whereas the run 0009 contains only CRISPR data from Fabio**.
You can find below the information we have recorded for these two runs (Excel tabular copy paste).

**Run 0004 was the first test with 12 barcoded amplicon libraries (SQK-PBK004) on flow cell FAK82993 (received 20.05.2019).**
Run was performed on 26.06.2019 for 4 hours.
Initial voltage was set to -180 mV.
Mux scan was set to 0.5 hours.
Basecalling (accurate) was performed live on EGSB-WS06 and took several days

Number of active channels at the beginning of the run: 1521
Number of active channels at the end of the run: 1309
Average read size were as expected: amoA - 550 bp; CRR1/CRR2 - 1500-2500 bp


**Run 0009 was performed with 12 barcoded CRISPR amplicon libraries (SQK-LSK109/EXP-PBC001) on flow cell FAL53759.**
* Run was performed on 17.12.2019 for 1.5 hours.
* Initial voltage was set to -200 mV.
* Mux scan was set to 0.25 hour.
* Basecalling (accurate) was performed live on EGSB-WS06 and took several days.
Samples sequenced were the following:

Number of active channels at the beginning of the run: 771
Number of active channels at the end of the run: 653




**De novo vs referenc**
As DBG methods were properly devised to exploit the huge amount of short reads generated by SGS platforms, and OLC algorithms were widely used in the Sanger sequencing era, both approaches are not appropriate to handle the long sequences with high error rates produced by TGS platforms.
